In March, 251 OSG users, resource providers, and staff convened virtually for the OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022. A benefit of this year's virtual format, all talks from the meeting are [avaliable to watch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVxyV0Lr1KiTeq7bTw3gwLw/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=1) on the OSG YouTube Channel. Reflective of the mission of the OSG 
Consortium, the meeting builds upon the goals central to the organization –– advancing open science via the practice of distributed high-throughput 
computing. This annual celebration of science has a reputation for both introducing researchers to services that transform their work, and also for 
cultivating discussion about how OSG can better serve the research community –– the [OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022](https://opensciencegrid.org/all-hands/2022/) was no exception to this rich history of transformation and discussion.

The meeting kicked off with a series of introductory talks on the PATh Project, the OSG Consortium, and the new [PATh Facility](https://path-cc.io/services/credit-accounts/). 
A highlight of the All-Hands Meeting each year, the David Swanson Memorial Award was presented to Colorado School of Mines PhD Student Connor Natzke, 
who gave an illuminating talk about how OSG services have impacted his investigations of the strong nuclear force. This exciting first day was wrapped up 
with a collection of talks given by researchers from a variety of scientific domains who use the Open Science Pool (OSPool) to advance their research.

On day two of the meeting, attendees focused on democratizing access to cyberinfrastructure. During the morning session, OSG Executive Director Frank 
Würthwein and NSF Program Director Kevin Thompson each delivered presentations on this topic, with Thompson highlighting how many of NSF’s priorities 
support the goal of democratizing access to cyberinfrastructure. In a similar thread, presenters Alan Blatecky, Joel Gerschenfeld, and Lauren Micheal 
discussed [the urgent need](https://www.rti.org/publication/missing-millions/fulltext.pdf) to address disparities across underrepresented communities in 
terms of computation, software, and data. Rounding out the morning session, Ana Hunsinger and Lawrence Williams of [Internet2](https://internet2.edu/) 
shared about their collaboration with several minority-serving institutions through the [Minority Serving – Cyberinfrastructure Consortium](https://www.ms-cc.org/)
(MS-CC). Day two’s afternoon session included a presentation from OSG staff about the services that OSG provides to campuses, and also a series of 
presentations from the campuses themselves, sharing their successes and challenges with incorporating OSG access points for their campus researchers and 
contributing resources to OSG. Watch the Missing Millions talk below, and browse the [complete collection of talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIeB7asuU4W6Nf-FrlxxARtDnKCDwyH1b) from day two.

The third day of the All-Hands Meeting began with a series of talks centered around the theme, ‘Integrating a Diversity of Capacity Resources into dHTC 
Pools’. OSG Technical Director Miron Livny discussed Access Points, and Frank Würthwein shared about the relationship between OSG and NRP. Additionally, 
Enol Fernandez and Gergely Sipos of EGI explained their goals of expanding their organization’s computing landscape, and Andrew Grimshaw presented on 
Lancium’s green, low-cost cloud computing. The second half of the day featured a variety of talks about OSG technology; including a token transition 
update, information on handling tokens with Vault, updates on the OSDF monitoring system, and a look into Kubernetes at the University of Chicago.

Day four of the All-Hands Meeting focused on multi-institutional collaborations that use OSG services. After a short introduction from OSG staff, 
representatives from LIGO, IceCube, Rubin Observatory, the SPT-3 and CMB-S4 experiments, and Fermilab’s Muon g-2 experiment each gave overviews of the 
ways that their collaboration uses OSG services. Watch the SPT-3 and CMB-S4 talk below, and browse the [complete playlist of talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIeB7asuU4W5O1RdHPy_jQz2aB8hP5Knl) from day four.

The final day of OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 was a joint effort between OSG and the U.S. LHC. The morning session covered common needs and development for 
XrootD, network activities and plans, and a discussion on HPC and clouds. In the afternoon, attendees discussed the IRIS-HEP Analysis Grand Challenge, 
token transitions in the context of GSI retirement, and caching and data lake infrastructure. Watch the Network Activities and Plans talk below, and
